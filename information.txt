Project Overview
===============================================================================

Welcome to SignaLab, an advanced software solution
designed by R&M Corporation for real-time visualization, analysis, and
recording of electrical signals. This tool has been developed for engineers,
technicians, students, and hobbyists requiring a flexible and powerful
virtual oscilloscope directly on their desktop.

Our suite offers an intuitive user interface and a comprehensive set of
features for signal analysis in both the time domain and frequency domain,
leveraging your computer's processing power to provide accurate measurements
and clear graphical representation.

===============================================================================
Key Features
===============================================================================

*   Multi-Channel Display:
    Simultaneously analyze two signal channels (Channel 1 and Channel 2).
    View channels individually or combined on a single graph for direct
    comparison.

*   Time and Frequency Domain Analysis:
    Seamlessly switch from standard time-domain display to frequency-domain
    spectrum display (FFT - Fast Fourier Transform) for each channel,
    allowing for in-depth analysis of signal harmonic components.

*   Precise Scale Controls (Volts/Div, Time/Div):
    Finely adjust vertical (Volts per Division) and horizontal (Time per
    Division) scales using custom spin-box controls. These offer predefined
    steps (1-2-5-7.5 sequence for Volts/Div, 0.5-1-2-5 for Time/Div) and
    unit selection (V, mV, uV for voltage; s, ms, us for time).

*   Integrated Trigger System:
    Stabilize the display of repetitive waveforms and capture specific events
    using the trigger system.
    - Edge Trigger: Activates the trigger when the Channel 1 signal crosses a
      dynamically calculated voltage level, which is the current average of
      the signal itself.
    - Selectable Slope: The user can select to trigger on a rising edge
      (Positive Edge), falling edge (Negative Edge), or both (interpretation
      of the "d/dt=x" checkbox when others are deselected).
    - Automatic Centering: The acquired waveform is automatically centered
      around the trigger point for easy analysis.

*   Data Logging:
    Start and stop logging of raw signal data (Channel 1 and Channel 2) for
    a predefined duration. Logged data can be saved to text files (.txt) for
    offline analysis or for import into other software.

*   Screenshot Capture:
    Save an image (.png or .jpg) of the current display tab's content, useful
    for documentation and reporting.

*   Tabbed User Interface:
    Easily navigate between different signal views (combined, Channel 1,
    Channel 2, and a side-by-side view for Channel 1 and 2) using an
    intuitive tabbed interface.

*   Functional Menus:
    Quickly access saving, logging, display settings, and this information
    file via the menu bar.

===============================================================================
Architecture and Technologies
===============================================================================

SignaLab has been developed using the following
key technologies:

*   Programming Language: Python 3
*   GUI Framework: PySide6 (Official Qt for Python bindings)
*   Graphics Library: PyQtGraph (for high-performance scientific plotting)
*   Numerical Library: NumPy (for efficient data buffer management and FFT
    calculations)

The software is structured in modules to ensure maintainability and
scalability. A `SignalSource` class simulates data acquisition, while
`GuiFunctions` orchestrates the interaction between the user interface and
the processing logic. The `OscilloscopeWidget` widgets (and their variants)
manage graph display, incorporating scaling logic, display modes, and
trigger management.

===============================================================================
Quick Start Guide
===============================================================================

1.  Startup: Run the `main.py` application.
2.  Signal Display: Simulated signals will be displayed automatically.
3.  Navigation: Use the tabs (Tab 1, Tab 2, etc.) to change the signal view.
4.  Scaling: Adjust "Volts/Div" and "Time/Div" using the controls in the
    side panel to zoom or scale the display.
5.  Frequency Domain: Use the "Channel 1" and "Channel 2" dropdowns under
    "View" in the side panel to switch from "Time D." to "FFT".
6.  Trigger:
    - In the "Trigger" panel, select "Positive Edge" to trigger on the
      rising edge of Channel 1 when it crosses its average.
    - Select "Negative Edge" to trigger on the falling edge.
    - Select "d/dt = x" (and deselect the other two) to trigger on both
      edges relative to the average.
    - If no trigger checkbox is selected, the oscilloscope operates in
      "free-run" mode (continuous update).
7.  Logging: Use the "RECORD" > "Start Recording" menu to log data.
    You will be prompted to save the file upon completion.
8.  Screenshot: Use "FILE" > "Save" to capture a screenshot of the active tab.

===============================================================================
Current Version Notes (v1.0.0)
===============================================================================

*   The signal source is currently simulated internally.
*   The trigger is based on Channel 1, and the trigger level is the dynamic
    average of the Channel 1 signal.
*   The "d/dt = x" functionality is interpreted as a combined trigger on both
    rising and falling edges if it's the only trigger option selected. It does
    not implement a user-configurable slope trigger.
